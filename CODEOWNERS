# This is a comment.
# Each line is a file pattern followed by one or more owners.

# These owners will be the default owners for everything in
# the repo. Unless a later match takes precedence,
# @global-owner1 and @global-owner2 will be requested for
# review when someone opens a pull request. e.g:
# *       @global-owner1 @global-owner2
*      @CBA-General/groupsec-edgesecurity-automation-admin @CBA-General/groupsec-edgesecurity-automation-write

# Order is important; the last matching pattern takes the most
# precedence. When someone opens a pull request that only
# modifies JS files, only @js-owner and not the global
# owner(s) will be requested for a review. e.g:
# *.js    @js-owner

# You can also use email addresses if you prefer. They'll be
# used to look up users just like we do for commit author
# emails.
# *.go docs@example.com e.g:

# In this example, @doctocat owns any files in the build/logs
# directory at the root of the repository and any of its
# subdirectories. e.g:
# /build/logs/ @doctocat

# The `docs/*` pattern will match files like
# `docs/getting-started.md` but not further nested files like
# `docs/build-app/troubleshooting.md`. e.g:
# docs/*  docs@example.com

# In this example, @octocat owns any file in an apps directory
# anywhere in your repository. e.g:
# apps/ @octocat

# In this example, @doctocat owns any file in the `/docs`
# directory in the root of your repository. e.g:
# /docs/ @doctocat
